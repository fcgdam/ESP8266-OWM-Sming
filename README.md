# ESP8266-OWM-Sming

This is a program for running on the ESP8266 using the Sming Framework.
Most of the program functions are for testing purposes, but one of the tests that works
well is the OpenWeather Web Services Client.

So if a basic OpenWeather Client is needed that displays the current location temp
and weather conditions on a 16x02 LCD I2C connected display to the ESP8266, this is it.

Other code is for testing the Phant Library port, and IoT device registration.
